## Code Signing
For non self signed read https://virtualgl.org/DeveloperInfo/CodeSigningHell

If you are happy with self signed certificates
we can thank soulehshaikh9 for their pfx certificate generator https://github.com/soulehshaikh99/self-signed-certificate-generator


## Gotchas

(in order which they seem most prevalent for me)

#### BadImageFormatException when Debugging
System.TypeInitializationException: 'The type initializer for 'Pizza.KeyboardAndMouseAdapter.Backend.Config.UserSettings' threw an exception.'
BadImageFormatException: An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007000B)

1. make sure your nuget packages are installed
2. Set your CPU to ANY instead of x64


#### "Markup is invalid"
1. Clean the projects
2. rebuild the solution


#### "Could not copy \Squirrel.exe"
you need to set "SquirrelToolsPath" in your project properties

eg if you have your project as 'D:\workspace\pancakeslp\PS4-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter\'

then your squirrel tools will be at  'D:\workspace\pancakeslp\PS4-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter\packages\squirrel.windows.1.9.1\tools'

so then  ` SquirrelToolsPath = packages\squirrel.windows.1.9.1\tools `


#### issue where WPFSpark is not found
1. remove WPFSpark from packages.config
2. Visual Studio Code > Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package manager Console
3. ` Install-Package WPFSpark `
