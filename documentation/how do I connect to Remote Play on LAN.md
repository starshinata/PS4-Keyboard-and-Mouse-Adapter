* PS Remote Play connects via a code <br>
  see [Playstation 4: add a device](https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/settings/adddevice.html) <br>
  This should mean you are using your local network, instead of going over the internet <br>
  <br>
  To confirm this, on your PS4 `Settings -> Remote Play Connection Settings --> Connection History --> select a connection` <br>
  After selecting a connection, you will see "Connection Method". If it says "Nearby" instead of "Via Internet", that should be local network.
