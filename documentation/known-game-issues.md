Instead of using PS4KMA, we advise you to plug a keyboard and mouse into your playstation<br>
Fornite has some built in keyboard and mouse functionality, so if you have atleast one keyboard button bound to a controller button, Fornite will get confused thinking you are trying to use both (mouse and keyboard natively) and (a PS controller)


## Last of us
Requires you to shake the controller to activate flash light. Our adapter doesnt have a shake function.
