    ## TLDR choice of ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, and macos-latest
    ## 2023.04.16  "windows-latest" yields "Windows Server 2022"
    ## it seems we have some dotnet framework 4.6.1 dependencies
    ## and Windows Server 2022 doesnt include 4.6.1 dependencies
    ## TODO once we have removed these dependencies we should retry windows-latest
